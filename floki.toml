# Main configuration file for Floki
#
# All settings are usually acompained by a short description and a sane default
#
# NOTE:
# when a size is needed, it's possible to specify
# it in bare bytes or with a case insensitive suffix 
#
# 1  | 1b => 1 byte
# 1k | 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1m | 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1g | 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
# when a duration is needed, it's also possible to specify
# it as bare seconds or using a case insensitive suffix
#
# 1  => 1 second
# 1s => 1 second
# 1m => 60 seconds
# 1h => 60 minutes
# 1d => 24 hours
#

# ====== SERVER CONFIGURATION ======

# Specify the ip and port which Floki should bind the socket to and listen for commands
bind_address="127.0.0.1:9797"

# Maximum number of clients connected at the same time
max_connections=1024

# Location of Floki data directory in the file system
data_directory="./data/"

# Sleep period between maintenance thread runs to checkpoint the queue metadata to disk
# There's little reason to change it
maintenance_interval="1s"

# ====== DEFAULT QUEUE CONFIGURATION ======

# Floki queues are stored as a collection of smaller segments on disk.
# Setting this value too small may limit the maximum size of a message and
# also slow down writes due to increased number of files.
# Segments are preallocated on creation so keep that in mind if you want to have lots of queues.
segment_size="128mb"

# Default queue message timeout period
# after this timeout a non acknowledged message will be made available in the channel again
message_timeout="30s"

# Soft retentions specify for how long (period) and how much data (size) is retained in a queue
# even if all channels already read past it.
# This might be usefull if you want to go back in time and reprocess some messages.
# Note: A value of 0 disables the feature if neither are active
# once all channels read past a segment it becomes eledgible for garbage collection
retention_period="0"
retention_size="0"

# Hard retentions specify the maximum age and/or size of retained data
# regardless of channel positions and soft retention period/size
# Note: A value of 0 disables the feature so the constraint isn't enforced and
# queue may grow unbounded(!)
hard_retention_period="24h"
hard_retention_size="0"
